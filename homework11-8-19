Lab: Conditional If
Will the following code work?  YES
$foo = 10;
$bar = 5;
if ( $foo > $bar )
    echo "Foo is greater than bar";
    $foo = $bar;
    echo "The value for Foo has changed";
Which statement runs as part of the conditional? echo "Foo is greater than bar";


Lab: For Loop
What does this code do?  Generates prime numbers greater than or equal to 5?
$max = 100;
for ($x = 5; $x < $max; $x++)
{
    // This if evaluation checks to see if number is odd or even
    $test = TRUE;
    for($i = 3; $i < $x; $i++) {
        if(($x % $i) === 0) {
            $test = FALSE;
            break;
        }
    }
    if ($test) echo $x . ', ';
}
